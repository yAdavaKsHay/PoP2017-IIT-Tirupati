week 2
#1. Everything is working fine except that research papers.I don't want to do any research and i have no interest in that but i'm interested in development,i want to develop something whatever it is,it dosen't matter that it's small or big  because to become a big developer we have to start from small things.


week 7
#1. Everything is fine except the interpreter because this is our first time. You should teach us how to make an interpreter. Take a lab session and teach us how to write program for interpreter. We know what is interpreter and how it works and how to make it but we are not able to write a program for it. Writing a program is the biggest problem for our team .You should do something about this.
